Authentication using OAuth 1.0a
=======================

### Using OAuth (1.0a)

A full introduction to OAuth is beyond the scope of the OpenPhoto documentation.
In all reality you probably don't need to understand all the ins and outs of OAuth; just grab one of our libraries and start building.

### Obtaining a consumer key and secret

Since OpenPhoto is distributed the flow to obtain a consumer key and secret differs slightly from typical OAuth applications.
Typically you would sign up for an application ID and be given a key and secret to be used with your app.
OpenPhoto differs because the host you'll be sending requests to is arbitrary and there's no central application repository.
