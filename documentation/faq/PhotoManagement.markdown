Photo Management
=======================

## How do I upload a photo?
Go to your OpenPhoto site (it'll look like yourusername.openphoto.me) and click Upload. Click Add Photos and add the photos you'd like to upload. You can also add attributes that'll apply to all the photos uploaded in that batch, such as a tag, an album, a privacy setting, or a license.

## How do I delete a photo?
Visit Photos under the Manage dropdown menu at your OpenPhoto site while logged in. From there, hover over the photo(s) you want to delete and click the checkmark that appears. Click Batch Edit and select Delete.

## What are albums? How do they work?
An album is a collection of photos grouped around a theme of your choice. This lets you share many photos with friends or browse your own photos more easily. Albums can be public or private on your albums page.

## How do I create an album?
While you're logged into your OpenPhoto site, visit Albums under the Manage menu. Enter the name of your album under the Create Album section and click Create.

## How do I add a photo to an album?
You can add a photo to an album by editing an individual photo's details or batch editing photos.

## How do I edit a photo's details?
Visit the photo's page and click "Edit Details". Then you can edit the title, description, tags, location, albums, groups, privacy, and license.

## How do I edit multiple photos at once?
Visit Photos under the Manage dropdown menu at your OpenPhoto site while logged in. From there, hover over the photo(s) you want to edit and click the checkmark that appears. Click Batch Edit and select the detail you want to edit, change the detail, and click Submit.

## What are groups? How do they work?
Groups let you share a photo with certain people without exposing the photo to the entire Web. Want to share photos from that party last week but don't want just anyone seeing them? Add the photos to a private group that only your friends have access to.

## How do I add a friend to a group?
Visit Groups under the Manage menu and create a name for a group. From there you can add your friends by email address.

## How do I add a photo to a group?
When you upload a photo, you can select a group for the photo to be part of. This is completely optional. You can also change the group(s) a photo is part of at the Manage Photos menu.
