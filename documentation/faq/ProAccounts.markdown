## How much does a Pro account cost?
A Pro account costs $29.99 a year.

## How do I upgrade from a free account to a Pro account?
Visit https://trovebox.com/upgrade, enter your credit card info, and enjoy your Pro account!

## How does unlimited space work with my storage service?
We don't limit uploads for Pro users, but you may face limits from your storage provider. If we're your storage provider then everything is unlimited. 

## Do I have to renew manually every year?
Nope. We'll alert you when your Pro account is going to renew.

## What happens if my Pro subscription ends?
Don't panic! Nothing has been deleted. You resume using a free account, though you're now subject to the free account limitations. You can still access all your photos, free or pro.
